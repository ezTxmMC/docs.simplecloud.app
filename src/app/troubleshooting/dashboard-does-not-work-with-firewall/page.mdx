# Dashboard does not work with firewall
In this troubleshooting you will find out why no statistics or data are displayed in your dashboard.

## Symptoms
- An error appears in the dashboard for the statistics: `Server Error: An unexpected error occurred`

## Possible Causes
- The Metrics Droplet is not started
- The firewall is activated, but ports 8080 to 8085 have not been publicly released
- One of the ports from 8080 to 8085 is already occupied

## Resolution
1. Open the file under `/components/controller/controller.properties`
2. There you will find an `ENVOY_START_PORT`. You can then adjust the start port here
