# Cannot connect to the dashboard
In this troubleshooting you will learn how to fix your faulty dashboard connection.

## Symptoms
- It throws me this error when im logging in to the Dashboard: `Invalid connection! The controller endpoint is invalid`

## Possible Causes
- The server where SimpleCloud is installed is offline
- The Controller Droplet is not started
- The firewall is activated, but ports 8080 to 8085 have not been publicly released
- One of the ports from 8080 to 8085 is already occupied

## Resolution
1. Start the Controller Droplet with the CLI command `sc start cloud`
2. If the controller has been started but you still cannot connect, then take a look at [this troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/dashboard-does-not-work-with-firewall).
