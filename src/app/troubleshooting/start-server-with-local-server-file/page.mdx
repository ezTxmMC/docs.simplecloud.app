# Start Minecraft server with local server file
In this troubleshooting you will find out how to correctly configure your own server software jar in your server group.

## Symptoms
- I have my own server software but do not have a url for this software

## Possible Causes
- An incorrectly configured `server-url` was set under `/groups/<serverGroup>.yml`
- The path of the server jar is incorrect or does not exist

## Resolution
1. Open the folder in the `/groups/` directory
2. Now open the config of your server group
3. Change the `server-url` so that it points to the path where your server jar file is located. For example, this could look like this: `file:/home/custom-paper.jar`. It is **important** that `file:/` is included at the beginning
4. Now save the config and restart your group

## Example of how the configs should look like
If you have followed the **step-by-step** instructions correctly, the configurations should look like this:
```yaml
name: lobby
type: SERVER
min-memory: 3072
max-memory: 4096
start-port: 50000
min-online-count: 2
max-online-count: 5
max-players: 50
new-server-player-ratio: 0
properties:
  server-software: Paper
  software-version: 1.21.4
  minecraft-version: 1.21.4
  server-url: 'file:/home/custom-paper.jar' # The path of your server jar must then be entered here
  configurator: paper_velocity
  template-id: dynamic
```
