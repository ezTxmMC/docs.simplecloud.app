# SimpleCloud Droplets

A droplet is our interpretation of a micro-service, that can extend the functionality of your SimpleCloud setup. They can be used to run custom code, interact with external services, or even to create a custom API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How to install a droplet?

If you have our [CLI](/cli) installed, you can install a droplet with the following command:

```bash
# Install a droplet
simplecloud droplet install <droplet-name>
```

To see a list of all available droplets, you can use the following command, or view the list of [official droplets below](#official-droplets):

```bash
# List all available droplets
simplecloud droplet list
```

## Why use droplets?

Droplets are a powerful way to extend the functionality of your SimpleCloud setup, without having to write a full-blown application. A droplet (micro-service) is focused on doing one thing, and doing it well. This makes it easy to maintain for us, and easy to scale for you.

This means that every important part of SimpleCloud v3 is now decoupled as good as possible and can theoretically be replaced by a custom droplet, or even not used at all.
For example, if you don't need the [CloudPlayer](/droplet/player), because you have your own player or don't need a player at all, you can simply not include our [player-droplet](/droplet/player) and you're ready to go.

## Are droplets replacements for v2 modules?

The simple answer is no. Droplets are not replacements for v2 modules. Some droplets may have similarities with existing v2 modules, but that's not our intention.
Most of the old modules can just be Velocity/BungeeCord/Spigot etc. plugins, that's why we decided to convert all old modules to new and simple [plugins](/plugin) from time to time.

<Note>
    If you have any ideas for new droplets, or plugins, feel free to join our [Discord](/https://discord.simplecloud.app) and share your ideas with us.

## Can I create my own droplets?

Yes, because a droplet is simply just a micro-service, you can create your own droplets. It's completely up to you how you create your droplets, but we have a small internal Tech-Stack that we use for our droplets.

Here is a list of our Tech-Stack:
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [JOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/)

Additionally, we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerize our droplets.

We don't use all of these technologies in every droplet, but we use them in most of our droplets. You can find the exact Tech-Stack of a droplet in the documentation of the specific droplet.

<Note>
    This is just our Tech-Stack, you can use any technology you want to create your own droplets. If you have any questions about creating your own droplets, feel free to join our [Discord](/https://discord.simplecloud.app) and ask us.

## Official droplets

We have created a few official droplets, that can be used to extend the functionality of your SimpleCloud setup. You can find a list of all official droplets below.
- [Server Host Droplet](/droplet/serverhost)
- [Server Host Docker Droplet](/droplet/serverhost-docker)
- [Player Droplet](/droplet/player)
- [Resource Pack Droplet](/droplet/resourcepack)
