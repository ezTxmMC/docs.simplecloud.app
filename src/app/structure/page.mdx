# Structure

SimpleCloud v3 has a new and more customizable structure. We have encapsulated all the core components to make it easier to extend your setup. This means you can easily replace all our [droplets](/droplet) and [plugins](/plugin) with your own implementations. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Key Components
- **Controller**: The heart of v3, managing server groups, online servers, and communicating with Server Hosts.
- **CLI** (Command Line Interface): A lightweight interface to connect to the Controller and manage your Cloud components. With the [CLI](/cli), you can send commands to the controller or install and manage droplets.
- **Server Host Droplet**: Handles server startup/shutdown with templates, running on Screens or Docker containers.
- **Droplets & Plugins**:
  - **Droplets**: Microservices for non-Minecraft tasks like player data (Player Droplet) or stats (Metrics Droplet).
  - **Plugins**: Enhance server features with Proxy (e.g., Notify, CloudCommand) or Server Plugins (e.g., Signs, NPCs).

## File structure

SimpleCloud has its core components that are needed, but they can be installed and used however you want. This means theoretically you can use any file structure you want. However, we **don't recommend** that and advise you to structure your files like this, as it works best in our experience and makes it easier to extend your setup with our [CLI](/cli).

    Keep in mind that if you change your file structure, there might be some things that will not work with our [CLI](/cli).

## Understanding Components

SimpleCloud v3 is structured into components - a broad category that includes both core system elements and [dropelts](/droplet). These components serve as the building blocks of the system, encompassing essential elements like the [Controller](/controller), [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) (necessary for the Dashboard), the Auto-updater, and the [CLI](/cli), alongside [droplets](/droplet).

We chose to use the term "components" to reflect this inclusive scope. This generic terminology allows us to consistently refer to all parts of the system, whether they are core elements or [droplets](/droplet).

## Auto-Updater

The auto-updater is a crucial part of SimpleCloud, ensuring that all components stay up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. It resides in the `components/auto-updater` directory and manages version control through `versions.yml`. The auto-updater is configured through its own `application.yml` file and updates itself before updating other components.

## Scripts

SimpleCloud uses Lua scripts as a dynamic component management system that enables seamless integration between the [CLI](/cli) and various components. When you execute a [CLI](/cli) command, these scripts act as bridges between the components and the [CLI](/cli), providing standardized methods for component control.

### How Scripts Work

When a [CLI](/cli) command is executed, it runs all scripts in the `components/scripts` directory. Each script must return three essential methods that the [CLI](/cli) can call:
- **start**: Launches the component
- **stop**: Terminates the component
- **status**: Checks the component's current state

This design makes the [CLI](/cli) dynamically extendable - you can integrate any standalone program (component or [droplet](/droplet)) into SimpleCloud by creating a corresponding Lua script that implements these methods.

### Script Structure

The scripts are organized into two main directories:
- **components/scripts/components/**: Contains individual component scripts
- **components/scripts/lib/**: Contains shared libraries and utilities

### Example Script

Here's an example of how a component script looks using our component factory:

```lua {{title: "components/scripts/components/controller.lua"}}
local component = require("component")

return component.create({
    name = "controller",
    session = "simplecloud-controller",
    jar = "controller-runtime.jar"
})
```

`component.create` returns the `start`, `stop`, and `status` methods that the [CLI](/cli) can call to manage the component.

### Creating Custom Components

You can easily create new components by adding a new Lua script in the `components/scripts/components` directory:

```lua {{title: "components/scripts/components/custom.lua"}}
local component = require("component")

return component.create({
    name = "custom",
    session = "simplecloud-custom",
    jar = "custom-runtime.jar",
    -- Optional: Custom Java options
    java_opts = {
        "-Xmx1g",
        "-Xms512m",
        "-XX:+UseG1GC",
        -- Add more options as needed
    }
})
```

### Creating Components that are not based on Java

We also support creating components that are not based on Java. It's basically the same as above, but you need to specify the `command` field instead of `jar`. Here's an example on how to do so:

```lua {{title: "components/scripts/components/custom_no_jvm.lua"}}
local component = require("component")

return component.create({
    name = "envoy",
    session = "simplecloud-envoy",
    command = "envoy -c envoy-bootstrap.yaml"
})
```

### Auto-Updater Configuration

The auto-updater has its own configuration:

```yaml {{title: "components/controller/controller.yml"}}
github-repository: theSimpleCloud/v3-releases
files:
  - release-file: controller-runtime.jar
    output-file: ../controller/controller-runtime.jar
  - release-file: controller-api.jar
    output-file: ../libs/controller-api.jar
```

### Component Properties

Every component is built and configured to use properties files for configuration. The properties file is located in the `components` folder and named `{component}.properties`.

If you want to create an own component, feel free to structure it as you like. We like to use a `.properties` file for configuration and a `.yml` file for the configuration of the auto-updater.

Here's an example of a properties file:
```properties {{title: "components/controller/controller.properties"}}
DATABASE_URL=jdbc:sqlite:database.db
GROUPS_PATH=../../groups
# GRPC Uncomment and change this if you want to change grpc defintions
GRPC_HOST=0.0.0.0
# GRPC_PORT=5816
# PUBSUB Uncomment and change this if you want to run pubsub on another port
# PUBSUB_GRPC_PORT=5817
AUTH_SECRET_PATH=../.secrets/auth.secret
```

### Cross-Platform Support

The scripts automatically handle platform-specific differences:
- **Unix**: Uses screen sessions for process management
- **Windows**: Uses background processes and batch files

<Note>
    The scripts are designed to work seamlessly across platforms. Make sure you have Java installed on your system. On Unix systems, the `screen` utility is required for process management.
