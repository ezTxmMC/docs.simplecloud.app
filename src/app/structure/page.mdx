# Structure

SimpleCloud v3 has a new and more customizable structure. We have encapsulated all the core components to make it easier to extend your setup. This mean you can easily replace all our [droplets](/droplet) and [plugins](/plugin) with your own implementations. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## File structure

SimpleCloud has its core components that are needed, but they can be installed and used however you want. This means theoretically you can use any file structure you want. However, we **don't recommend** that and advise you to structure your files like this, as it works best in our experience and makes it easier to extend your setup with our [CLI](/cli).

<Note>
    Keep in mind that if you change your file structure, there might be some things that will not work with our [CLI](/cli).
</Note>

## Scripts

We decided to use a handful of scripts to make it easier to interact with SimpleCloud, and also to make you don't depend on our [CLI](/cli). You can find all scripts in the `scripts` directory.

In the future, we will have a "smart" way to only install the scripts that are needed for your operating system. For now, all scripts are installed by default.

Every component has its own script to start and stop it, and a `.properties` file to configure it. This enables you to easily configure your setup on your behalf, and makes our auto-updater very easy to use. Each property file is located in the main directory of the component. Here is an example of how the [controller](/controller) script and `.properties` file looks like:

```bash {{title: "scripts/controller.sh"}}
#!/bin/bash

```

```properties {{title: "controller/controller.properties"}}
#
```
