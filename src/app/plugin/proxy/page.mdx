## MOTD Features

### Message Customization and Rotation
The MOTD system allows you to create multiple messages that can either be displayed statically or rotate randomly. This is particularly useful for announcements, maintenance notices, or showcasing different aspects of your server. Combined with MiniMessage format support, you can create rich text displays with gradients, colors, and advanced formatting.

```yaml
# Configuration examples are yet to be added.
```

### Player Information and Version Display
Customize how your server presents itself in the server list. Configure custom player count displays, maximum player limits, and even modify the server version string. This feature allows you to create engaging server list entries that stand out.

```yaml
# Configuration examples are yet to be added.
```

## Tablist Features

### Dynamic Headers and Footers
Create engaging tablist headers and footers that update automatically. The plugin supports both static and animated content, with configurable update intervals. You can display real-time information like player counts, server status, or custom messages. All text supports MiniMessage formatting for advanced styling.

```yaml
# Configuration examples are yet to be added.
```

### Server-Specific Displays and Information
Configure different tablist appearances based on which server a player is currently on. This feature allows you to create unique experiences for different game modes or server types. Combined with placeholders, you can display server-specific information like game statistics or server status.

```yaml
# Configuration examples are yet to be added.
```

### Real-Time Updates and Animations
Control how often your tablist updates and what information it displays. The plugin can show real-time player statistics, ping information, and server status. Create animated sequences that cycle through different messages or information displays.

```yaml
# Configuration examples are yet to be added.
```

<CodeGroup>
```java {{title: 'Tablist Event Example'}}
@Subscribe
public void onTablistConfiguration(TablistConfigurationEvent event) {
    TablistConfiguration config = event.getTablistConfiguration();

    // Modify header
    Component header = config.getHeader()
        .replaceText(TextReplacementConfig.builder()
        .match("%CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDER%")
        .replacement("<red>Custom Text</red>")
        .build());

    config.setHeader(header);
}
```
</CodeGroup>
