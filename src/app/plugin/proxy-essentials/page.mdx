## Quick Setup

1. Download the plugin for your proxy software
2. Place it in your proxy template's plugins folder
3. Start your proxy server
4. Start by setting a joinstate for your group (e.g. `maintenance` for your proxy group)

## Features

### Server Info
You can use multiple layouts that you can create in the `layout/` folder. 
These layouts allow you to generate multiple messages that can be displayed either statically or rotated randomly. 
This feature is especially useful for announcements, maintenance notices, or highlighting different aspects of your server. 
With support for MiniMessage format, you can create visually rich text displays that include gradients, colors, and advanced formatting options.

```yaml
first-lines:
- <color:#0ea5e9>A simplecloud.app network
second-lines:
- ' '
player-info: []
version-name: ''
max-player-display-type: REAL #or DYNAMIC
dynamic-player-range: 1 #Only enabled if max-player-display-type is DYNAMIC
```

    alt=""
    className="w-full"
/>

<Note>
    If the proxy runs locally on your computer, the actual slots are displayed because the controller performs health checks and information requests by pinging the proxy. Players, however, see different information.
</Note>

### Tablist Header and Footer

Create engaging tablist headers and footers that update automatically. The plugin supports both static and animated content, with configurable update intervals. You can display real-time information like player counts, server status, or custom messages. All text supports MiniMessage formatting for advanced styling.

```yaml
groups:
-   group-or-service: '*'
    tab-lists:
    -   header:
        - ''
        - <color:#0ea5e9>SimpleCloud v3
        - 'Frame 1'
        footer:
        - ''
        - ' <color:#ffffff><online_players> players <color:#cbd5e1>are playing on
            your network '
        - <color:#64748b>  sɪᴍᴘʟᴇᴄʟᴏᴜᴅ.ᴀᴘᴘ
        - ''
    #Create another list entry to display multiple tablists in rotation
    -   header:
        - ''
        - <color:#0ea5e9>SimpleCloud v3
        - 'Frame 2'
        footer:
        - ''
        - ' <color:#ffffff><online_players> players <color:#cbd5e1>are playing on
            your network '
        - <color:#64748b>  sɪᴍᴘʟᴇᴄʟᴏᴜᴅ.ᴀᴘᴘ
        - ''
tab-list-update-time: 1000 #The 1000 is the update interval in milliseconds
```

### Joinstates

Joinstates replace the old maintenance feature and set an entire server group to a state where only players with a specific permission can join. If it’s a proxy, a specific server info layout can also be applied. In this example, we have defined three states:
- `public`: All players can join the server group without requiring any permission.
- `closedBeta`: Only players with the specified permission can join the server group.
- `maintenance`: Only players with the specified permission can join the server group, making it ideal for team members.
```yaml
#This state is assigned to newly created groups.
default-state: public
join-states:
-   name: public
    join-permission: '' #Keep it empty to allow everyone to join
    full-join-permission: simplecloud.join.full.public
    motd-layout-by-proxy: public
-   name: closedBeta
    join-permission: simplecloud.join.closedbeta
    full-join-permission: simplecloud.join.full.closedbeta
    motd-layout-by-proxy: closed_beta
-   name: maintenance
    join-permission: simplecloud.join.maintenance
    full-join-permission: simplecloud.join.full.maintenance
    motd-layout-by-proxy: maintenance
```
