# SimpleCloud Plugins
Plugins are there to provide extended functionality directly in game. They often times use the SimpleCloud [API](/api) to be able to provide their features. {{className: 'lead'}}

## Installing a plugin
Just drag the downloaded jar into your [server groups](/server-group) plugin folder, which is defined by your [template](/template) (also see [structure](/structure) for default locations)

## Plugins vs v2 modules
Most plugins are implementing the same functionality as old SimpleCloud v2 modules. All modules that provide in game functionality (e.g. sign module) are now just called SimpleCloud plugin and
operate as a server plugin.
