# Servers

Servers are the individual instances created from server groups. Each server inherits its configuration from its parent group while maintaining its own unique state and runtime properties. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Understanding Servers

Each server in SimpleCloud represents a running Minecraft instance. Servers are automatically created and managed based on their group configuration:

- Inherit properties from their parent group
- Maintain individual state and runtime data
- Can be individually configured and managed
- Support hot-reload of most configuration changes


## Server Management

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Start a specific server
sc start server lobby-1

# Stop a server
sc stop server lobby-1

# Edit server configuration
sc edit server lobby-1 --max-players 100
```

## Server Lifecycle

### Creation
Servers are automatically created by the controller when:
- The minimum online count hasn't been reached
- A manual start is requested
- The player count requires more capacity

### Runtime
During operation, servers:
- Report their status to the controller
- Handle player connections
- Maintain their own logs and data
- Can be modified without restarts

### Shutdown
Servers are gracefully stopped when:
- Manually requested
- No longer needed (player count decreases)
- Cloud system shuts down

### Runtime Configuration

Servers support various runtime configurations in `/components/serverhost/options/` with the follwing properties:

```yaml
# Server-specific properties
max-players: 100
state: RUNNING
port: 25565
host: "localhost"
```

## Server States

A server can be in one of these states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| PREPARING | Server is being created |
| STARTING | Server is starting up |
| RUNNING | Server is operational |
| STOPPING | Server is shutting down |
| STOPPED | Server has stopped |

## Server Properties

### Core Properties
These properties are managed by the controller:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| uniqueId | Unique server identifier |
| groupName | Parent group name |
| port | Server port |
| host | Server host address |
| state | Current server state |

### Custom Properties
Servers can have additional custom properties defined:

```yaml
cloud-properties:
  custom-setting: "value"
  plugin-config: "enabled"
```

## Server Files

Each server maintains its own directory structure when using the (Server Host Droplet)[/droplet/serverhost]:

```
running/
└── <group>/
    └── <server>/
        ├── logs/
        ├── plugins/
        ├── worlds/
        └── server.properties
```

## Server Templates

Servers use templates from their parent group for initialization. The template system is implemented through the (Server Host Droplet)[/droplet/serverhost], which handles file management and server preparation. Without the (Server Host Droplet)[/droplet/serverhost], you'll need to implement your own file management system. For detailed information about template configuration and usage with the (Server Host Droplet)[/droplet/serverhost], see the [Templates](/resources/template) documentation.

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
- Monitor server performance
- Configure appropriate memory limits
- Use proper shutdown procedures

2. **Configuration**
- Keep server-specific changes minimal
- Document custom configurations
- Use group templates for shared settings
