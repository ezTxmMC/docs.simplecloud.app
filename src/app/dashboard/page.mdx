# Dashboard
The dashboard offers a user-friendly and efficient interface for managing all essential cloud functions, streamlining operations and enhancing productivity.

## Understanding the Dashboard
The dashboard is a web application that, like the [CLI](/cli), allows you to manage your cloud instance. 
It serves solely as an interface that sends commands to the controller or droplets and retrieves information. 
You cannot start the controller directly from the dashboard; it must be started locally beforehand.

### Key Features
Here are the standout features of our dashboard:
- **Server Insights**: Start, stop, and monitor individual sub-servers on their dedicated pages. A console and file browser are directly integrated!  
- **Group Management**: Create new server groups and edit them as needed. View all essential information on the group overview page.  
- **File Browser**: Edit all templates through our integrated file browser. Upload new worlds, configurations, etc., or modify files directly in the dashboard.  
- **Custom Branding**: Tailor the dashboard to your branding by setting your logo and project name and assigning custom banners to server groups.  

Upcoming Features:  
- **Users and Permissions**: Create roles for your developers.  
- **Monitoring**: View extensive statistics about your cloud instance in the form of clear graphs directly in the dashboard. This feature requires the Metrics Droplet.  


## Login

For anyone who doesn't want to install the dashboard on their own machine, feel free to use the dashboard we host ourselves.

    }}
/>

1. Go to [dashboard.simplecloud.app](http://dashboard.simplecloud.app)
2. Enter your controller endpoint, including your IP and port 8080 (Example: `187.420.69:8080`)
3. Enter your controller secret, which you can find under `/components/.secrets/auth.secret`

## Installing the Dashboard

<Note>
    Self-hosting won’t be available during the Public Beta, as we want to squash all major bugs first. That way, you won’t have to deal with constant updates right after launch. Don't miss any updates on our [Community Discord](https://discord.simplecloud.com).
