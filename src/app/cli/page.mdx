# SimpleCloud CLI

The SimpleCloud CLI provides a powerful command-line interface to manage all aspects of your cloud system. From creating groups to managing servers, the CLI offers comprehensive control over your SimpleCloud installation. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Quick Setup

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{title: 'Unix'}}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSimpleCloud/simplecloud-manifest/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

```batch {{title: 'Windows'}}
# Download and run install.bat from:

```
</CodeGroup>

## Why a Modern CLI?

SimpleCloud v3 marks a significant shift from the traditional Manager Console to a modern CLI approach. This change brings several key advantages:

### Remote Management
Unlike v2's Manager Console that required direct server access, the CLI can be installed and run from anywhere. This means you can manage your cloud system from your local machine while the cloud runs on remote servers.

### Interactive Experience
The CLI provides an interactive experience that guides you through complex operations:
- Step-by-step group creation wizards
- Smart autocompletion for commands and parameters
- Real-time validation of inputs

### Automation Capabilities
Command line interfaces excel at automation:
- Easy integration with scripts and tools
- Support for continuous integration workflows
- Batch operations for repetitive tasks

<Note>
    While the v2 Manager Console served its purpose well, the CLI represents a more flexible and powerful approach to cloud management that better serves modern server administration needs.
