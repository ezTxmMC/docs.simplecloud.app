# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up for a SimpleCloud installation that is comparable to the [SimpleCloud v2](https://github.com/theSimpleCloud/SimpleCloud) experience. We'll cover the [CLI](/cli), standardized official [Droplets](/droplets) and the new [API](/api) design.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Installing SimpleCloud

SimpleCloud now offers an extensive [CLI](/cli) that cover everything you need to manage SimpleCloud. It's the easiest way to get started with SimpleCloud. You can install it with the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'Unix' }}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSimpleCloud/simplecloud-manifest/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

```bash {{ title: 'Windows'}}
# Create a install.bat file and paste the content of the following website into it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSimpleCloud/simplecloud-manifest/HEAD/install.bat
# Now you can run the install.bat file
```
</CodeGroup>

From now on, you can use the SimpleCloud CLI to manage SimpleCloud. You can find all commands in the [CLI documentation](/cli).

Now that we have installed the [CLI](/cli), we can start installing our pre-built bundle of SimpleCloud. This bundle contains everything you need to get started with SimpleCloud. You can install it with the following command:
<CodeGroup>
```bash
sc install bundle
```
</CodeGroup>

This lets you choose where you want to install all our core components. If you already have a running SimpleCloud instance and you want to add another Root Server, you can take a look at the [Server Host Droplet](/droplet/serverhost) and [Server Host Docker Droplet](/droplet/serverhost-docker) when you're using Docker.

## Running SimpleCloud

Starting the cloud is very simple. By executing the following command, the cloud will try to access and start every component that is needed to run SimpleCloud.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
sc start cloud
```
</CodeGroup>

Under the hood, the CLI will run a script in your installation directory. This script will start everything you need to run SimpleCloud. If you want to customize the script, you can find it in the `scripts` directory.

Currently, we don't have a way to start a specific component with the CLI, but we are working on it and each component has an own script. For now, you can start a specific component by searching for the correct script in the `scripts` directory.

## Creating a Proxy Group

Now that we have a running SimpleCloud instance, we can create our first group. A group is a group of Minecraft servers that are managed by the [Controller](/controller). You can create a group with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
sc create group
```
</CodeGroup>

// TODO: Show the entire interactive installation process

## Creating a Server Group

To run a Minecraft server, you need to create a [Server Group](/server-group). You can create a server group with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
sc create group
```
</CodeGroup>

// TODO: Show the entire interactive installation process & what's different to the proxy group
