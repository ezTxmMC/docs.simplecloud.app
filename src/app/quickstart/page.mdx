# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up for a SimpleCloud installation that is comparable to the [SimpleCloud v2](https://github.com/theSimpleCloud/SimpleCloud) experience. We'll cover the [CLI](/cli), standardized official [Droplets](/droplets) and the new [API](/api) design.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Installing SimpleCloud

The SimpleCloud Installer will install the SimpleCloud [CLI](/cli) as well as the core of the cloud.

<Note>
    To get started with SimpleCloud, it is advised to use our [CLI](/cli), since you will only receive support for most topics if you do so (the only other way to run SimpleCloud is to [put it together yourself](/structure)).
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'Unix' }}
wget https://github.com/theSimpleCloud/installer/releases/latest && ./install.sh
```

```bash {{ title: 'Windows'}}
# You have to download the Installer files manually.
./install.bat
```
</CodeGroup>

## Running SimpleCloud

<Note>
    Only do this if you installed via the installer.
</Note>

For the CLI to be functional a running SimpleCloud instance is required. To start the cloud, execute the following command.

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ title: 'Unix' }}
./run.sh
```
```bash {{ title: 'Windows'}}
./run.bat
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setting up SimpleCloud

If you chose to build a SimpleCloud environment by yourself, you have a lot more to go through before you can start.

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/structure" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Read the docs about setting up a working SimpleCloud environment</>
  </Button>
</div>
