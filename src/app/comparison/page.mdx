# Comparison
On this page, we compare SimpleCloud v3 with other Minecraft cloud solutions (CloudNet and PoloCloud) and Kubernetes. We briefly discuss our development journey and share our experiences with different solutions. Our goal is to remain as objective as possible. This page aims to highlight which solutions are most suitable for different target audiences, rather than positioning SimpleCloud as the ultimate choice.

<Note>
    This comparison is based on our research and subjective evaluation. If any information is incorrect or outdated, please feel free to let us know on our [Discord](https://discord.simplecloud.app)!
</Note>

We compare SimpleCloud v3 with the most well-known alternatives, as well as other software solutions, regardless of Minecraft. We always compare the latest version of the software. The alternatives include:
- [CloudNet v4](https://github.com/CloudNetService) by the CloudNetService Team
- [TimoCloud](https://github.com/TimoCloud/TimoCloud) by Timo Zikeli and Lasergott
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)

If you think we've missed a solution, just send us a quick message on our [Community Discord](https://discord.simplecloud.app)!
