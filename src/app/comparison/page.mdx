# Comparison
On this page, we compare SimpleCloud v3 with other Minecraft cloud solutions (CloudNet and PoloCloud) and Kubernetes. We briefly discuss our development journey and share our experiences with different solutions. Our goal is to remain as objective as possible. This page aims to highlight which solutions are most suitable for different target audiences, rather than positioning SimpleCloud as the ultimate choice.
