# Permissions

SimpleCloud v3 does not include a built-in permission system. Instead, we recommend using LuckPerms, the industry standard for Minecraft permission management. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Migration from v2

If you're upgrading from SimpleCloud v2, we provide a migration tool to convert your existing permissions to LuckPerms:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
# Convert v2 permissions to LuckPerms format
sc migrate permissions

# Specify custom database location
sc migrate permissions --database /path/to/database.db
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    The migration tool automatically handles the conversion of all permissions, groups, and user data from your v2 installation.
</Note>

## Why LuckPerms?

Instead of "reinventing the wheel" by creating our own permission system, we recommend LuckPerms for several compelling reasons:

1. **Feature Completeness**
   - Comprehensive permission management
   - Advanced inheritance system
   - Temporary permissions
   - Track system for promotions/demotions
   - Web editor for visual management

2. **Reliability**
   - Battle-tested in production environments
   - Active development and maintenance
   - Large community support
   - Regular updates and improvements

## Best Practices

1. **Network Setup**
   - Use a central database for multi-server setups
   - Keep plugin versions consistent across servers
   - Regular permission data backups

2. **Permission Management**
   - Use the web editor for complex changes
   - Implement clear group hierarchies
   - Document permission assignments
